> Combining a manga library and a manga gacha system

### Library
Stores all your saved manga in a neat organization.

### Manga
Shows details about a manga - its cover, title, and synopsis. Clicking on the title here will redirect you to its page in `mangadex.org`. You can also choose to save the manga into your library.

### Add
You are able to add a manga of your choice into your library just by entering its `id` from `mangadex.org`. An example is provided.

### Gimme
Gives you a random manga based on your selection of genre and tags. You will be redirected to its manga page and have the option to save the manga into your library.

### Afterwords
I probably want to make a blog system so that recommending manga is possible especially those that are less popular and only appeared thanks to RNG (*coughs* oneshots).
